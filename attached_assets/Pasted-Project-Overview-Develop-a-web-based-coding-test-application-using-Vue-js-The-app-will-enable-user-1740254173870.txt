Project Overview:
Develop a web-based coding test application using Vue.js. The app will enable users to solve AI-generated coding problems by writing and running code within an integrated development environment (IDE). The solution will be verified by an AI, and the app should provide real-time feedback. The design should remain simple yet extensible, making use of best practices for UI/UX, security, state management, and code quality.
1. Main Interface

Components & Layout:

    Code Editor:
        Integrate a Vue-compatible code editor component (such as Monaco Editor, Ace Editor, or CodeMirror) with syntax highlighting, basic formatting, and optional autocomplete.
        Ensure the editor integrates seamlessly with Vue components.

    Console/Output Area:
        Include a terminal-style section to display output or errors after code execution.
        The console should update dynamically based on code execution results.

    AI-Generated Question Panel:
        Place a panel on the right side that displays a coding question generated by an AI.
        Ensure this panel updates dynamically, based on user interactions and settings (like difficulty).

    Action Buttons:
        "Run" Button: Executes the code from the editor in a secure, sandboxed environment.
        "Submit" Button: Sends the user’s solution, along with the question and context (e.g., selected difficulty), to an AI API.
            The API response should indicate correctness and provide a detailed explanation.
            Display a success message with explanation on correct answers, or a failure message with guidance if incorrect.

Enhanced UI/UX:

    Use a Vue UI framework such as Vuetify, Element Plus, or Bootstrap Vue for a consistent and responsive design.
    Ensure the layout is responsive so that the interface adapts well on both desktop and mobile devices.
    Implement clear visual cues and error messaging to improve the overall user experience.

2. Settings Panel

Components & Features:

    Access Method:
        Provide a gear icon or menu item that opens the settings panel, either as a modal or separate view.

    Configuration Options:
        AI Integration Settings:
            Input fields for API keys for multiple AI models (e.g., GPT-3, GPT-4).
            A dropdown to select the desired AI model.
        Default Prompt Field:
            A text area where users can set a default prompt that guides the AI’s question generation.
        Difficulty Level Selector:
            Implement a three-step control (Easy, Medium, Hard) that influences the complexity of AI-generated questions.

State Management & Persistence:

    Use Vuex or Pinia for managing application state such as settings, API keys, current question, and user preferences.
    Persist settings in local storage so that preferences remain across sessions.

3. Code Execution and AI Verification

Execution Environment:

    JavaScript Execution:
        For JavaScript code, execute safely within the browser using a controlled evaluation method.
    Other Languages:
        If supporting additional languages, set up a backend service (using Node.js and Express) to run code in a sandboxed environment.
        Ensure robust error handling and security measures to prevent malicious code execution.

AI Verification:

    When the user clicks "Submit":
        Send the code, question, and relevant context (e.g., difficulty) via Axios or the Fetch API to an AI API.
        Parse the API response to determine if the solution is correct, and display a success or failure message along with a detailed explanation.

4. Development Best Practices & Enhancements

Modularity & Code Organization:

    Organize the application into small, reusable Vue components (e.g., CodeEditor.vue, Console.vue, QuestionPanel.vue, SettingsPanel.vue).
    Use Vue Router for navigation between views if needed (e.g., switching between main interface and settings).

Performance Optimization:

    Implement lazy loading of components where applicable, using Vue Router’s code-splitting capabilities.
    Optimize API calls and consider caching responses where appropriate.

Testing & Documentation:

    Include unit and integration tests using Jest and Vue Test Utils to ensure each component functions correctly.
    Document components and functions with inline comments and a README file for overall project guidance.

Developer Experience:

    Integrate ESLint and Prettier for consistent code style and quality.
    Utilize Vue CLI with hot module replacement (HMR) for efficient development and immediate feedback during coding.

Error Handling & Security:

    Include comprehensive try/catch blocks for code execution and API interactions, providing clear error messages to the user.
    Ensure that any code execution is done in a sandboxed and secure manner, especially when processing untrusted code.

5. Final Deliverables

    A fully functional Vue.js application that includes the main interface with an integrated code editor, console output, AI-generated questions, and a settings panel.
    Backend integration (if necessary) for securely running code in a sandboxed environment.
    Documentation and unit tests to facilitate further development and maintenance.
    Clean, modular, and well-documented code following best practices.
